# Bulldozer Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning regression model to predict the sale price of bulldozers using historical auction data.  
The dataset includes features such as equipment specifications, usage, and sale timing.  
The model was trained, tuned, and evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² to assess performance.  

Key highlights:
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and handle missing values.  
- Engineered relevant features (time-based variables, categorical encodings).  
- Trained and evaluated multiple models, selecting the one with the best predictive performance.
